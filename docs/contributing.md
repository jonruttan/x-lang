## Build Prerequisites

- A C89-compatible compiler (gcc, clang, tcc, c89, c99)
- POSIX shell (`sh`) for test runners
- Make
- The git submodules (`ext/x-expr` — the expression engine the build
  requires — and `tests/c/test-runner`): clone with `--recursive`, or run
  `git submodule update --init` in an existing clone

```sh
make clean && make
```

## Code Style

### C Code

- **C89 standard** — no C99 features. Variables declared at the top of the FUNCTION (house rule, stricter than C89's top-of-block); hoist via guarded initializers or assign-in-place
- **`x_` prefix** — All exported symbols use the `x_` prefix
- **Naming** — Use `pair`/`first`/`rest`, never cons/car/cdr. Use `fn`/`def`/`set!`/`do`/`op`/`lit`/`quasi`/`match`
- **No globals** — All interpreter state belongs on `p_base`. Never use static or global variables for state
- **Stack-allocated pairs** — Prefer `x_satom_t`/`x_spair_t` over heap allocation where possible
- **Doxygen comments** — All public functions and macros documented with `@brief`, `@param`, `@return`. File headers include `@file`, `@brief`, `@author`, `@copyright`, `@license`, and the ASCII owl

### x-lang Code

- **Module structure** — Dependencies via `(import ...)`, exports via `(provide ...)` at file bottom
- **Documentation** — Wrap definitions in `(doc ...)` forms with `(param ...)`, `(returns ...)`, description string
- **No `cond`/`convert` in tokenizer callbacks** — Use nested `if` and direct C primitives to avoid GC corruption
- **File extension** — `.x`

### Method Naming (adjudicated — one name per concept)

- **Element access is `ref`** on every class (`List ref`, `Vector ref`, `Str8 ref`,
  `Gen ref`, `Obj ref`, `Ptr ref`). `Str8 index` survives as a documented alias;
  don't add new `nth`/`index` methods.
- **`length` is the property; `count` is the action** (see the [glossary](glossary.md)).
  Every finite collection exposes `length` — List, Vector, Vec, Str8, StrUTF8,
  Seq, Dict, Set (Dict/Set store it, O(1)). `count` names genuine tallying acts
  only: `Gen count` (consumes the stream — a lazy stream has no length
  property), `Seq count` (the cursor-walk the default `length` delegates to),
  `Heap count` (walks the heap chain), and the verb-compounds `count-if`
  (List), `match-count` (Regex), `count-from` (Gen). Never add a `count` that
  merely reads a size — that's a `length`.
- **Predicates are `any?` / `all?` / `none?`**; iteration for side effects is
  `for-each`. (Not `every?`, not `each`.)
- **Conversions are `->x` / `from-x`** as class methods (`Dict ->alist`,
  `Hash ->hex`, `Vector ->list` / `from-list`). The bare `X->Y` globals
  (`list->str`, `str->number`) are the pre-class boot layer only — don't add new ones.
- **Association vocabulary** (see the [glossary](glossary.md)): an **assoc** is one
  dotted `(key . val)` pair; an **alist** is a list of assocs; a **plist** is the
  flat `(k v k v ...)` shape, legal ONLY in option stores (the `%opt-cell`
  family: `let-opts`, `Assoc opt-get-or`/`opt-get-or-else`, `new`, `new-from`);
  a **bindings list** is `((key value) ...)` two-element lists, the `let` shape.
  The word "pairs" appears in NO method name — pairing producers (`List zip`,
  `Gen zip`/`enumerate`, `List group-by`) emit alists; the converters are
  `Dict from-alist`/`->alist` and `Assoc from-bindings`/`->bindings`. Equality:
  the alist layer (`Assoc get`, `assoc-get`) compares keys with `eq?`;
  `List assoc` (`equal?`) and `List assq` (`eq?`) return the assoc itself and
  are the presence-unambiguous entry doors.
- **Constructor-style counts come first**: `(List repeat n x)`, `(Str8 repeat n s)`,
  `(Str8 make k ch)`, `(Vector make n fill)`.
- **Doc type vocabulary** — one token per concept in `(param ...)`/`(returns ...)`:
  `INT` (not INTEGER), `BOOL` (not BOOLEAN), `CALLABLE` (not FUNCTION), plus
  `ANY STRING SYMBOL LIST PAIR CHAR NUMBER VECTOR REGEX FLOAT BIGNUM RATIONAL
  COMPLEX ITER OBJECT CLASS PTR BUF`. `PROCEDURE`/`OPERATIVE` are reserved for
  the fn/op constructors' returns. Class names (`Dict`, `Vec`, `Random`, ...)
  are legitimate returns types as-is. `make check-doc-vocab` enforces the
  banned aliases.
- **Absence discipline** (normative; the full statement is spec.md's "Nil,
  false, and truthiness"): falsy = {nil, `#f`} only; predicates answer
  `#t`/`#f`; misses return nil (never `#f`); nil-storable slots need a
  presence door (`has?` / presence-based `-or`), never a value sentinel;
  index misses are `-1`; boundaries carry foreign null as the symbol `null`.
- **Arguments are subject-LAST** (the dispatched value is the final parameter),
  matching value-call dispatch: `("a,b" split ",")` → `(Str split "," "a,b")`.
  Deliberate exception: the `File`/`Sys` OS layer mirrors POSIX and stays
  handle-first (`(File write fd data)`); fds are ints and never value-dispatch.

## Testing

### Test Structure

Tests are markdown spec files in `tests/x/specs/` organized by category:

- `core/` — Language fundamentals (evaluation, forms, closures, logic, arithmetic, strings, etc.)
- `applicative/` — Higher-order function tests
- `ext/` — Extension types (bignum, float, rational, complex, regex, compile, POSIX)
- `lib/` — Standard library functions
- `e2e/` — End-to-end integration tests
- `tools/` — Tool tests (lint, fmt)

### Running Tests

```sh
make test-x          # x-lang spec suite
make test-c          # C unit tests
make test            # all tests (the full gate)
make test-asan       # both suites under AddressSanitizer (memory-safety net)
```

### Adding Tests

Tests use a markdown format where each `###` heading is a test case:

```markdown
## section-name

### test description

\`\`\`scheme
(expression)
\`\`\`
---
    expected output
```

The spec runner evaluates the `scheme` code block and compares stdout against the indented expected output after the `---` separator.

> **Last line only (default).** By default the runner compares only the **last non-empty stdout line**, and stderr is discarded. To assert a single multi-value result this way, put it on one line (e.g. `(display a)(display " ")(display b)`).
>
> **Multi-line output (`` ```output ``).** Fence the expected block as `` ```output `` to compare the **full multi-line stdout** instead — for formatters, pretty-printers, and any multi-line render. Leading blank lines are ignored and the trailing newline is trimmed; interior blank lines are significant. Errors are catchable too: the harness prints an uncaught error to stdout as `Error: <value>`, so a `` ```output `` block can assert it (or use `raised`/`throws?`). See `tests/x/specs/meta/multiline.spec.md`.
>
> A spec can swap in a custom support library with a `# @lib ../tests/x/lib/NAME.x` header — it *replaces* the default lib, so the support file must `(include "lib/x-core.x")` first (see `tests/x/lib/token.x`).

### The test-with-fix rule

**Every bug fix ships with a regression test in the same commit**, written so it **fails before the fix and passes after** — confirm both. A fix without a test that proves it is incomplete: nothing stops the bug from returning. This is the project's main defense against recurring "should-have-been-caught" regressions. A `fix:` commit that touches no `tests/` file is the smell to avoid.

### Error-path assertions

`tests/x/lib/assert.x` names the "this must raise" pattern, so the silent-failure class (a form that should raise but returns nil) can't read as a pass. Add `# @lib ../tests/x/lib/assert.x` to a spec, then:

- `(throws? (fn (_) EXPR))` → `#t` if `EXPR` raises, else `#f`
- `(raised  (fn (_) EXPR))` → the value `EXPR` raised, or the symbol `%none`

### Memory safety (AddressSanitizer)

`make test-asan` runs both suites against an ASan build. It catches the crash class that is silently wrong on 64-bit but faults on 32-bit/Pi (e.g. an unchecked read past an object) — run it before pushing C or eval-core changes. The baseline is **clean** (since 2026-07-13) and CI hard-gates it: a red ASan run is a real regression. Note the pinned `ASAN_OPTIONS` in the Makefile — leak detection is off (the GC does not free at exit) and so is the fake stack (incompatible with stack-copying call/cc).

### Pre-push gate

```sh
make install-hooks   # sets core.hooksPath=.githooks
```

The hook hard-gates on `make test` (both suites) and blocks the push if it fails (bypass a single push with `git push --no-verify`). `make test-asan` is green at HEAD but slow (~2-3x), so locally it stays opt-in — `RUN_ASAN=1` runs it non-blocking; CI hard-gates it on every push regardless.

### CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) hard-gates every push and pull request on `make test` (macOS + Linux) **and** `make test-asan` (Linux). The pre-push hook remains the first line of defence: it catches a red suite before it leaves the machine.

## Commit Conventions

This project follows [AngularJS commit conventions](CONVENTIONS.md):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Only `feat` and `fix` appear in changelogs.

## Documentation

### Generating Docs

```sh
make doc-c           # C API reference (Doxygen → docs/ref/c/)
make doc-x           # x-lang library reference (doc-gen → docs/ref/x/)
make doc             # both
```

### Adding Library Documentation

Wrap function definitions in `(doc ...)`:

```scheme
(doc (def my-function
  (fn (_ x y)
    (+ x y)))
  (param x INTEGER "First operand")
  (param y INTEGER "Second operand")
  (returns INTEGER "Sum of x and y")
  "Add two integers.")
```

The `(doc ...)` form is transparent — it evaluates the inner `def` normally, then registers metadata for the doc generator.
